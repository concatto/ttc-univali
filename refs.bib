@article{Rambaran2017,
abstract = {In this study, the associations between peer effects and academic functioning in middle adolescence (N = 342; 14–15 years old; 48{\%} male) were investigated longitudinally. Similarity in achievement (grade point averages) and unexplained absences (truancy) was explained by both peer selection and peer influence, net of accep-tance, and connectedness. Friendships were formed and maintained when adolescents had low levels of achievement or high levels of truancy. Friends influenced one another to increase rather than decrease in achievement and truancy. Moreover, friends' popularity moderated peer influences in truancy in reciprocal friendships but not in unilateral friendships, whereas friends' acceptance moderated peer influences in achievement in both unilateral and reciprocal friendships. The findings illustrate the dynamic interplay between peer effects and academic functioning.},

abstract = {The structure of scientific collaboration networks is investigated. Two scientists are considered connected if they have authored a paper together and explicit networks of such connections are constructed by using data drawn from a number of databases, including MEDLINE (biomedical research), the Los Alamos e-Print Archive (physics), and NCSTRL (computer science).

abstract = {Graph vertices are often organized into groups that seem to live fairly independently of the rest of the graph, with which they share but a few edges, whereas the relationships between group members are stronger, as shown by the large number of mutual connections. Such groups of vertices, or communities, can be considered as independent compartments of a graph. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. The task is very hard, though, both conceptually, due to the ambiguity in the definition of community and in the discrimination of different partitions and practically, because algorithms must find ``good'' partitions among an exponentially large number of them. Other complications are represented by the possible occurrence of hierarchies, i.e. communities which are nested inside larger communities, and by the existence of overlaps between communities, due to the presence of nodes belonging to more groups. All these aspects are dealt with in some detail and many methods are described, from traditional approaches used in computer science and sociology to recent techniques developed mostly within statistical physics.},

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as “modularity” over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

This paper presents seven scalable heuristics for modularity density and compares them with literature results from exact mixed integer linear programming and GAOD, iMeme-Net, HAIN, and BMD-$\lambda$ heuristics. The results are also compared with CNM and Louvain, which are scalable heuristics for modularity maximization. The results suggest that our seven heuristics are faster than GAOD, iMeme-Net, HAIN, and BMD-$\lambda$ modularity density heuristics. Our experiments also show that some of our heuristics surpassed the objective function value reported by iMeme-Net, Hain, and BMD-$\lambda$ for some real graphs. Our seven heuristics were tested with real graphs from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection and the experiments show that they are scalable. This feature was confirmed by an amortized complexity analysis which reveals average linear time for three of our heuristics. Hypothesis tests suggest that four proposed heuristics are state-of-the-art since they are scalable for hundreds of thousands of nodes for the modularity density problem, and they find the high objective value partitions for the largest instances. Ground truth experiments in artificial random graphs were performed and suggest that our heuristics lead to better cluster detection than both CNM and Louvain.},

@article{Nascimento2013,
abstract = {Complex systems in diverse areas such as biology, sociology and physics are frequently being modelled as graphs, that provide the mathematical framework upon which small scale dynamics between the fundamental elements of the system can reveal large scale system behavior. Community structure in a graph is an important large scale characteristic, and can be described as a natural division of the vertices into densely connected groups, or clusters. Detection of community structure remains up to this date a computationally challenging problem despite the efforts of many researchers from various scientific fields in the past few years. The modularity value of a set of vertex clusters in a graph is a widely used quality measure for community structure, and the relating problem of finding a partition of the vertices into clusters such that the corresponding modularity is maximized is an NP-Hard problem. In this paper we present a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) with path relinking, for solving the modularity maximization problem in weighted graphs. A class of {\{}0,1{\}} matrices is introduced that characterizes the family of clusterings in a graph, and a distance function is given that enables us to define an l-neighborhood local search, which generalizes most of the related local search methods that have appeared in the literature. Computational experiments comparing the proposed algorithm with other heuristics from the literature in a set of artificially generated graphs and some well known benchmark instances, indicate that our implementation of GRASP with path relinking consistently produces better quality solutions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Agarwal2008,
abstract = {In many networks, it is of great interest to identify "communities", unusually densely knit groups of individuals. Such communities often shed light on the function of the networks or underlying properties of the individuals. Recently, Newman suggested "modularity" as a natural measure of the quality of a network partitioning into communities. Since then, various algorithms have been proposed for (approximately) maximizing the modularity of the partitioning determined. In this paper, we introduce the technique of rounding mathematical programs to the problem of modularity maximization, presenting two novel algorithms. More specifically, the algorithms round solutions to linear and vector programs. Importantly, the linear programing algorithm comes with an a posteriori approximation guarantee: by comparing the solution quality to the fractional solution of the linear program, a bound on the available "room for improvement" can be obtained. The vector programming algorithm provides a similar bound for the best partition into two communities. We evaluate both algorithms using experiments on several standard test cases for network partitioning algorithms, and find that they perform comparably or better than past algorithms.},

@article{KarimiMajd2015,
abstract = {One of the challenging problems when studying complex networks is the detection of sub-structures, called communities. Network communities emerge as dense parts, while they may have a few relationships to each other. Indeed, communities are latent among a mass of nodes and edges in a sparse network. This characteristic makes the community detection process more difficult. Among community detection approaches, modularity maximization has attracted much attention in recent years. In this paper, modularity density (D value) has been employed to discover real community structures. Due to the inadequacy of previous mathematical models in finding the correct number of communities, this paper first formulates a mixed integer non-linear program to detect communities without any need of prior knowledge about their number. Moreover, the mathematical models often suffer from NP-Hardness. In order to overcome this limitation, a new hybrid artificial immune network (HAIN) has been proposed in this paper. HAIN aims to use a network's properties in an efficient way. To do so, this algorithm employs major components of the pure artificial immune network, hybridized with a well-known heuristic, to provide a powerful and parallel search mechanism. The combination of cloning and affinity maturation components, a strong local search routine, and the presence of network suppression and diversity are the main components. The experimental results on artificial and real-world complex networks illustrate that the proposed community detection algorithm provides a useful paradigm for robustly discovering community structures.},
